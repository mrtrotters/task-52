# Task 52 - Hangman

This is the submission from myself, for task 52 - Hangman. 

You will be given a 5 letter word to guess. Click the letters on the page to select your guess. 
If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the answer. 
If it does not appear in the word, you will slowly build the hangman with each incorrect guess.
 You get 11 guesses before you kill him.
